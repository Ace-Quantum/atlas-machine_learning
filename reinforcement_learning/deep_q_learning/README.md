This is a readme that I intend on actually (minimally) filling out

These are some commands you might need to run in your terminal:
pip install gym[atari, accept-rom-license]==0.21.0
pip install gym[atari,accept-rom-license]==0.21.0
pip install gym[atari]
pip install autorom[accept-rom-license]
pip install import

As I had to completely reset my WSL, there were a lot of installations
that I had to reinstall. I'm sure a lot of them are standard
So you more than likely have most of them
Let me know if there's any issues.

Other things:
pip install gym
pip install PIL
pip install Pillow
pip install torch
pip install cv2
pip3 install opencv-python
