This is a readme that I intend on actually (minimally) filling out

You'll notice regularly in the notes that I'm constantly referencing the tutorial over and over again,
And the idea of rewatching it to clear up my understanding of certain parts.
It's 2.5 hours of tutorials, so I'm unsure if I'll get that done before pushing this for a grade.

These are some commands you might need to run in your terminal:
pip install gym[atari, accept-rom-license]==0.21.0
pip install gym[atari,accept-rom-license]==0.21.0
pip install gym[atari]
pip install autorom[accept-rom-license]
pip install import

As I had to completely reset my WSL, there were a lot of installations
that I had to reinstall. I'm sure a lot of them are standard
So you more than likely have most of them
Let me know if there's any issues.

Other things:
pip install gym
pip install PIL
pip install Pillow
pip install torch
pip install cv2
pip3 install opencv-python
