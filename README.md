# atlas-machine_learning
	Hello! My name is Ace, and I’m the creator of this Repo. I started school in the fall of 2023, and am set to graduate in the spring of 2025! I have a passion for data, so I’m very lucky to have the opportunities I do at school. Through hard work and determination I’ve overcome adversities centered around my health, and I wake up every day ready for the chance to change the world, hopefully through the usage of data science.
	
	This repo contains a majority of the work that I’ve done for the Machine Learning specification track at school. I’ve had to delete and recreate this repo once or twice, most recently due to forgetting to include h5 files in my git ignore. So far there are 3 folders, Math, Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised Learning. Each of them have challenged me in a variety of ways, and there are many projects that have been simply left unfinished due to time constraints. I intend on revisiting them at some point so I can ensure my understanding of the source material.

Thank you for your time! Please feel free to connect with me on LinkdIn!
